This folder contains code allowing reproducibility of results presented in Leoni et al., 2021, "Fink: early supernovae Ia classification using active learning"


sigmoid.py: 
    functions related to the sigmoid feature extraction
    
classifier_sigmoid.py: 
    functions related to filtering points on the rise and concatenation with extra features (SNR, npoints, chi2) with sigmoid fit parameters

early_sn_classifier.py:
    global functions for feature extraction and learning loop. 
    User choices are restricted to lines 462-497.
    In order to generate the first data matrix it is necessary to access the AL_data folder, which is provided in an accompaning file.
    
mean_model.ipynb:
    Extract best performing model from a given query strategy, save pkl file and generate list of alerts used of training.
    
plots/:
    Folder of jupyter notebooks for reproducing the plots in Leoni et al., 2021
